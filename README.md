# DataQualityAssuranceTask

In this project, I refactored the two .py files which use data from the .xlsx files. I also added the functions create_filtered_dataset, create_hire_records to improve the function of the code

## To note
● All of these files are extracted from a single client
● The data is extracted from multiple databases
● Accuracy and completeness of the data are crucial
● The data provided by our client may present accuracy and completeness issues

## Instructions:
1. Refactor the 2 .py files to ensure the pipelines will run smoothly and efficiently.
  ○ This could include adding methods to handle or bypass issues during execution to
prevent pipeline disruptions.

As you work on the task, consider the following:

1. Data Quality Assurance
  a. How will you ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data?
  b. What specific checks will you implement to detect and handle potential data issues?
Consider both basic data integrity checks and more contextual validations, similar
to the check_all_employees_have_a_hire_record function in the employment.py
file.
  c. What kind of data issues or inconsistencies might arise during processing, and how
would you address them?

2. Reusability and Efficiency: how can you ensure that the processing logic can be reused
for regular, efficient and accurate data refreshes?
